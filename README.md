#### Overcoming User Inertia

An issue we wanted to resolve for this project was the initial inertia a potential user might encounter when downloading BracketRunner. While visiting a website is generally not an obstacle to user engagement, downloading an app is often seen as a larger commitment for someone to make (due to various permissions, memory, etc.). Thus, we wanted to develop an emulator to showcase the features of the app that could be utilized within the web browser.

The API we decided to use to accomplish this goal is [Appetize.io](https://appetize.io/docs#api-overview). Not only would this allow us to put an emulation of the app on a web page, but it would also provide some styling so that the app appeared to play on an iPhone (generation of our choosing).
